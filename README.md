# Brainly-bypass
Chrome extension that bypasses Brainly's 1 answer/day restriction.

# Installing
1. Head over to your chromium based browser's extensions menu and toggle developer mode on
2. Drag and drop the most recent .crx file provided in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Rafaeruo/brainly-bypass/releases) onto the extensions menu

If I were you I would just use this intead: [equivalent extension released on chrome web store and what not](https://github.com/nitrog0d/brainly-blocker)
