# Brainly-bypass
Chrome extension that bypasses Brainly's 1 answer/day restriction.

# Installing
1. Head over to your chromium based browser's extensions menu and toggle developer mode on
2. Drag and drop the most recent .crx file provided in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Rafaeruo/brainly-bypass/releases) onto the extensions menu

The way Brainly does the checking is so dumb that it's very likely that it will change in the future, and so, this could stop working at any time. Last checked: Aug. 2021.
